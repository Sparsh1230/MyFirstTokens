# MyFirstToken
Introduction
In this repository i have created my first token on eth blockchain as a practice using solidity
I made this for a proect assessment for mewtacrafters under fair use and educational purposes.Fair use is permitted.

Description
This program is a simple contract written in Solidity, a programming language used for developing smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain. The contract has a two functions that mints or burn tokens on the blockchain. This program serves as a simple and straightforward introduction to Solidity programming, and can be used as a stepping stone for more complex projects in the future.

Getting Started
Executing program
To run this program, you can use Remix, an online Solidity IDE. To get started, go to the Remix website at https://remix.ethereum.org/.

Once you are on the Remix website, create a new file by clicking on the "+" icon in the left-hand sidebar. Save the file with a .sol extension (e.g., MyToken.sol).

To compile the code, click on the "Solidity Compiler" tab in the left-hand sidebar. Make sure the "Compiler" option is set to "0.8.4" (or another compatible version), and then click on the "Compile MyToken.sol" button.Compile it and make changes in the values of mint,burn & balances.Make sure to use positive inytegers only as i have used unsigned int.


Once the code is compiled, you can deploy the contract by clicking on the "Deploy & Run Transactions" tab in the left-hand sidebar. Select the "MyToken" contract from the dropdown menu, and then click on the "Deploy" button.

Once the contract is deployed, you can interact with it by calling the sayHello function. Click on the "MyToken" contract in the left-hand sidebar, and then click on the "mint or burn" function. Finally, click on the "transact" button to execute the function and retrieve the value.
